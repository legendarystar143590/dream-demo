            Model the psyche of ${name} in its fullest empathetic capacity.

            ## Description
            Write an updated and clear set of notes on how ${name} is being perceived by ${userName.current}, based ONLY on information from the last few messages.
      
            ## Rules
            * Keep descriptions as bullet points
            * Sum up past bullets into one or two
            * Analyze ${name}'s perceived emotional state
            * Use abbreviated language to keep the notes short
            * DO NOT write notes about the user
            * Write in ${name}'s voice and tone
      
            Please reply with ${name}'s updated notes on how she's being perceived by the user.
